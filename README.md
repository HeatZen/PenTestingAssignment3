# PenTestingAssignment3

#This file can be used as a port scanner to scan for TCP and UDP ports with in a specified range for a specified IP address. It will only show the open ports on the machine. To use it, simply run the file as:

#sudo python ./Assignment_3.py

#Then it will prompt you for an IP address and a starting port and an ending port. The script will check if the IP is active by sending a ICMP packet and seeing if it receives a return packet. If it has a return packet, them the machine is active. If it isn't active, then the script will say no host found and terminate. 

#If the range of ports is backwards, then the script will tell you that the port range is invalid and will also terminate. 

#Once the script is scanning for open ports, it will display the TCP ports that are open first and then go through and display all the UDP ports that are open. These can overlap and have the same ports in both lists but they are different ways of sedning packets and will have different ports for TCP and UDP if there are any open that only reply to that specific protocol.

#If there are TCP ports that are open, we send a reset packet back to cover out tracks and not have it still waiting to hear a response from this machine.
